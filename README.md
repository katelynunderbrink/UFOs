# UFO Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage for the client "Dana". This webpage will allow users to filter by multiple criteria to find UFO sightings. 


## Results

### How to use the webpage

To use the webpage, you must enter in a filter search option under the "Filter Search" section to the left of the page. You can enter just one or multiple filter options but the more specific you get the less results will show. It is recommended just to enter in one filter at a time.

  - Enter Date - Type a date in the format of M/DD/YYYY
  - Enter City - enter city using all lowercase letters
  - Enter State - enter state using two letter state abbreviations all in lower case. ex "fl" for "Florida"
  - Enter Country - the only country available in this dataset is "us". 
  - Enter Shape - shape variables include: circle, light, triangle, unknown, fireball, formation, other, chevron, sphere, disk, rectangle, cross, flash, changing, oval, cigar, teardrop, cylinder


## Summary
The drawback of this design is that the variables are case and type sensitive so if someone types in a filter incorrectly it will not pull up the options correctly. Additionally, with a small dataset it is almost impossible to filter by multiple filters and still pull up any results. 

It is reccomended to add more to this dataset and allow for more flexibility within filtering the dataset by case and type.
